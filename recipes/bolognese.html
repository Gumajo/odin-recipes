    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup finely diced onion</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup finely diced celery</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely diced carrot </li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch caaayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 cups white wine</li>
        <li>1 can whole italian plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups 2% milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook onion, celery, and carrot with pinch of salt until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir ground beef into vegetables and cook, stirring constantly until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Season meat mixture with 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until most of the milk has evaporated and bottom of pan is still slightly saucy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Raise heat to medium high and pour white wine into ground beef mixture; cook and stir until white wine has mostly evaporated, about 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing bowl and crush them with your fingers until they resemble a slightly chunky sauce. Pour tomatoes into sauce; fill can with 2 cups water and add to sauce. Bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until mixture cooks down into a thick sauce, at least 3 hours but preferably 4 to 6 hours. Skim fat from top of sauce if desired. If sauce is too thick or too hot on the bottom, add a little more water. Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.</li>
